### About this repo:

This repository contains a notebook exploring the burn scar for the 2017 Thomas Fire in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties in California. For the assignment, I visualize a satellite image over the burn area in false color to highlight the burn scar and overlay it with the outline of the Thomas Fire burn perimeter.
